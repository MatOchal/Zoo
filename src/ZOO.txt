README.txt

TO RUN THE ZOO SIMULATION:
	java Simulation arg[0] arg[1] arg[2]

	The simulation may take up to three arguments (inclusive):
	arg[0] - filename, in format of FILENAME.txt
	arg[1] - delay in milliseconds between months, expressed as integer
	arg[2] - display mode choice, expressed as integer 
		0 - very limited detail of the simulation
		1 - information about each foodstore and each animal in the enclosure at the end of the month
		2 - detail information about each animal, information about enclosures, and detail information about zookeepers and jobs that they have carried out throughout the month
	
	If any of the arguments are not specified the Simulation assumes default values:
	arg[0] – example.txt
	arg[1] – 500
	arg[2] – 1

FILE STRUCTURE
	ZOO DEFINITION FILES
		
		The format of the file is strict.
		It does not allow incorrect syntax of any definitions after a zoo definition. Any definitions, in fact any characters, before a Zoo definition will be ignored. This is allows writing comments about that particular file
		It does not allow animal definition before an enclosure definition
		It does not allow zookeeper definition before an enclosure definition
		It allows defining multiple zoos in one file.

INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNAL STRUCTURE
	The .java files should be commented appropriately explaining in depth the functionality of program and the choices made.

EXTENTIONS
	Additional features have been added to the core specification of the Zoo Coursework. 
	These include:
		1. Animal ability to breed
		2. Choosing display mode and time latency
		3. Zookeeper ability to look after several enclosures

TROUBLESHOOTING
	RUNNING SIMULATION AFTER COMPILING
	NoSuchMethodFoundException : To solve try to compile the classes again where this error occurs and then compile and run the Simulation
